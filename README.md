Mixed-college hikes have a habit of splitting back into the same friend groups. Trail Bingo gives everyone a reason to talk to someone new: each player gets a shuffled 5×5 card and fills a square only by finding a hiker from a **different college** who matches the prompt.

## Features

- **Shuffled cards:** every player gets a different 5×5 card with a free centre square.
- **Rules built in:** same-college signatures are blocked, and each person can sign a limited number of squares on one card.
- **Exco tiles:** gold squares that only organisers can sign, using a shared code.
- **Reward ticket:** finishing the card unlocks a ticket with a check code to show organisers.
- **Works offline:** a service worker keeps the app working on the trail with no signal, and players can install it to their home screen.
- **No backend:** each card is saved on the phone, and nothing is tracked or sent anywhere.
- **Admin page:** organisers can change settings live from a phone, without touching code.

## How it works

The project is a static site on GitHub Pages: plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no build step or dependencies.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js` | The game |
| `config.json` | Live settings, read by the game on launch and written by the admin page |
| `admin.html`, `admin.css`, `admin.js` | Settings dashboard for organisers |
| `admin-key.json` | Encrypted GitHub token used by the admin page (see Security) |
| `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` | Offline support and home-screen install |

### Admin page

`admin.html` reads and writes `config.json` through the GitHub Contents API. Saving a setting creates a commit, Pages redeploys it, and phones pick up the change the next time they open the app. Settings come from a small schema (`SETTINGS` in `admin.js`), so adding a toggle only takes one line there plus a key in `REMOTE_KEYS` in `app.js`.

## Security

- **No plain-text secrets in the repo.** The admin page's GitHub token should be a fine-grained token limited to this repository's contents. It's encrypted in the browser with AES-GCM, using a key derived from the admin password with PBKDF2-SHA256 (600,000 iterations), and only the ciphertext is stored in `admin-key.json`.
- **The exco code is hashed.** It's stored as a PBKDF2-SHA256 hash (`excoCodeHash`), so it never appears in the public files.
- **Limits.** This is a static site, so every check runs on the phone. The rules keep the game fair for players who play along, but they aren't tamper-proof. That's a reasonable trade-off for a hike icebreaker, so don't use this setup for anything high-stakes.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcrangers/hike-bingo.git
cd hike-bingo
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

A local server is needed (rather than opening the file directly) for the service worker and `fetch("config.json")` to work.

## Customise

- **Prompts and colleges:** edit the `CONFIG` block at the top of `app.js`.
- **Live settings:** change these from the admin page. They include the win rule, signs per person, the loading screen and the exco tiles.
- **Force a refresh:** after a large change, bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` so installed copies update.
